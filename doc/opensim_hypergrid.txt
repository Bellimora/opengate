Open Stargate Network v400
==========================

========================================================

Does the code work with / support OpenSim?
------------------------------------------ 

Boy do I wish I could channel the raw enthusiasm I see for this into
the OpenSim project.

The more correct question to ask here is "Does OpenSim currently support
enough LSL functionality to run the Open Stargate Network
code?"

At this time, the answer is unfortunately "no".

According to http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Download , "As OpenSim is
still at an alpha code maturity stage, there is absolutely no guarantee
that functionality works or is stable, even in the numbered releases."
That web page has had that notice for over 3 years now, and I have no hope
that the OpenSim team has it together enough to ensure a stable set of base
features.  They seem much more motivated to add crazy new whizbang features
than to produce a stable bugfree platform with a complete set of base
functionality.

The Open Stargate Network relies on a large number of
features available on the Linden Main Grid which simply aren't implemented
yet in OpenSim.

I have spent about a week attempting to port the code to OpenSim.
To that end, I have contributed a number of patches to the OpenSim
project.

Sadly, I have realized that what I consider to be a logical goal for
OpenSim (100% LSL compatability) is not one of their actual goals.
I find this attitude frustrating and difficult to work with.
Patches I've submitted to OpenSim have been met with a great deal
of "Not Invented Here" combined with a lack of appreciation for the
"Principle of least astonishment".  I could rant on, but the short story
is that OpenSim's LSL implementation is laughably broken, and will not
likely improve for some time.  (See http://opensimulator.org/mantis
bugs 3199, 3187, 3144, 3174, 3201, 3176, 3145, 3157, 3152, and 3143)
(In particular, see http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=3187 and
http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=3144 for an example of what
I'm talking about) (See also http://www.alpha-fox.com/community/topic.php?id=251
; I'm not the only one who has had this problem with them.)

As of v205, the code should at least compile in OpenSim.  I have removed
reliance on several SecondLife LSL features not currently supported in
OpenSim.  However, since I am not actively maintaining this, there is no
guarantee that they will not creep back in.

Actual support for OpenSim would require another experienced C# developer
to fix OpenSim's horribly broken LSL implementation.  I have neither 
the time nor the patience to deal with the OpenSim development team any
further.

At minimum, OpenSim should support llEmail, llRequestURL, and
and http_request.  The methods are critical for intersim object
communications.  The documentation currently *says* it supports
these things, but if you look more closely, you will find that their
implementation is incomplete and nonfunctional for the purposes of
allowing objects in different sims to communicate with each other.

I am, as always, willing to accept patches that work around OpenSim's
limitiations if they do not impair the functionality of the code on the
main grid.  To date, no one other than me has submitted any such
patches.

Will the code work with OGP or Hypergrid?
---------------------------------------- 

Yes, but don't get too excited just yet.

The same code that allows dials to other networks (/dial >alteran, etc...)
could in theory also work with OGP or Hypergrid regions.  However,
since no grid besides the Linden main grid supports LSL, (see above)
there's not much point.

I've recently learned the OpenSim Hypergrid Team has their
own Stargate project.  Their event horizon textures and DHD
sculpt maps look familiar.  I wonder where they got them from?  See
http://www.mariasworlds.com/2009/04/internet-history-made-today-travels-thorugh-the-stargate/
and
http://opensimulator.org/wiki/HyperGrid_Team/Current_Projects/HyperGrid_Stargate
for more details.  While the Hypergrid team is part of OpenSim, and
is therefore in theory open source, their stargate source code is not
available to the public.  IMs to project maintainers have gone unanswered.
