Automatic Updates
-----------------

Because all gates must work together in a network, it is sometimes
necessary to update software on all gates to correct bugs which affect
the entire network.

From time to time, members of the opengate admin group may stop by to
update software on your gate.  This is often done by a bot (an avatar
controlled by a computer program), who will appear, update the gate,
and leave.  Update bots will not speak or interact in any other way.

Banning opengate update bots from your parcel or region means you won't
get software updates, and you risk having your gate disconnected from
the network.

Gates which continue to cause problems and cannot be reached by our
update bots may be remotely deleted.
