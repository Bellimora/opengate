Stargate Aliases
----------------

Aliases are set by adding them to the name field of the object, in square
brackets.

A complete list of Stargates and Stargate aliases can be found at
http://opengate.ma8p.com/list.cgi

When dialing, a case insensitive match is done on the following:

  * Stargate address code (seven different symbols)
  * Stargate address alphacode (seven different uppercase letters)
  * Stargate region name (i.e. "Rowling")
  * Stargate region name plus owner name (i.e. "Rowling Doran Zemlja")
  * Stargate region name plus display name (i.e. "Rowling Doran")
  * Stargate alias (i.e. "my alias")

Matches are done in the order shown.  i.e. if there is a Stargate in the
region named "Gamma" and there is also a Stargate with an alias of "Gamma",
dialing Gamma will ALWAYS get you the Stargate in the region named Gamma.

If there are multiple matches at the same level then one of them is chosen at
random.  i.e. if there are two Stargates in the region Gamma, dialing Gamma
will give you one or the other at random.  However, to speed lookups,
once a Stargate gets a match, it will remember that match until
some other Stargate is dialed.  i.e. the first dial to Gamma will be a random
gate in Gamma, but subsequent dials from that same gate will go to the same
destination in Gamma, until some other address is dialed.

Stargates may have multiple aliases.  An alias appears in square brackets
in the Stargate object name.  i.e. If you name your object "OpenGate
[prime] [my alias]" it's aliases will be "prime" and "my alias".

The special symbols used for Stargate addresses can also be used as part
of an alias.  Since SL does not allow special symbols in object names,
escape sequences are required.  The sequences \A through \Z, \0 through
\9, and \. and \- are used to substitute for the special symbols.

As a shorthand, an alias beginning with a ~ is assumed to be all symbols, so
the alias [\A\B\C] is the same as [~ABC].

Aliases with unicode characters can also be created by using u+XXXX to
represent a unicode code point.  For example, [u+661fu+9580] would be the
Chinese Traditional alias for "Star Gate".

Note that while it is possible to set an alias with repeating symbols, the
DHD cannot dial it.  Also note that normal Stargate addresses are searched
first, so an alias cannot be used to hijack another Stargate's address.

Please do not copy a gate, or rez multiple copies of gates, for the
sole purpose of getting a specific gate address.  The odds of getting a
specific gate address by copying gates is about 1 in 20 million.  It is
futile.  The best way to get your gate to respond to an old address is
to use a special symbol alias, as described above.

A Stargate will never dial itself.
