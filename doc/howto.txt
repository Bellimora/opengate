How to use a Stargate
---------------------

There are two ways to dial an Open Network Stargate; voice command or DHD (see
below).

Once the Stargate dials, the Event Horizon (blue swirly thing) will appear.
Click it and a map will appear.  Click the "teleport" button on the map,
and you will teleport to your chosen destination.

To acheive "walk through" teleports, see http:automap.html

Voice Commands
--------------

To dial a random destination by voice, stand near the Stargate and say

/dial

To dial a specific destination by voice, stand near the Stargate and say

/dial <alias>

Where <alias> is an alias for the destination Stargate.  As an alternative
to "/dial <alias>", the Stargates will also respond to a number of other
dial commands.  This was done as a compatability convenience for travelers
who may be familiar with other Stargate networks.

* Slow dialing commands
   * /s <alias>
   * /dsgc <alias>
   * /sgc <alias>
* Fast dialing commands
   * /d <alias>
   * /dial <alias>
   * dd:<alias>
* Asgard dialing commands:
   * /a <alias>
   * /asgard <alias>

An <alias> may be the region name of the Stargate (i.e. "laserlight"), the
region name followed by the owner name (i.e. "laserlight doran zemlja"),
a special alias (i.e. "my alias"), or a special seven symbol address.

See http:alias.html for a more detailed explanation of Stargate aliases.

Stargates listen to both channel 0 (the public channel) and channel 123 (for
compatability with other Stargate networks).

DHD
---

As an alternative to voice commands, Stargates will also respond to commands
from the symbol based DHDs.  Stargate addresses can be entered via DHD.
A one prim sculpted symbol based reference DHD is part of the standard
distribution, and can be found near many Stargates.
