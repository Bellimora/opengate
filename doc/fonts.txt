Problems with Viewer Fonts
--------------------------

The symbol addresses use unicode characters in the range U+263C
through U+2653.  Some users may have trouble with these characters.
If your SL Viewer displays these as question marks or small boxes,
there is a problem with the fonts.  Note that this is a Viewer problem,
and NOT an LSL problem.

If you have problem seeing fonts, try the following:

* First, we need to open the advanced menu.
* On a PC you can enable the advanced menu by hitting Ctrl-Alt-D
* From the Advanced Menu, select "Debug Settings..."
* The two settings we're interested in are "FontSansSerif" and "FontSansSerifFallback"
  * FontSansSerif MtBkLfRg.ttf
    * This is the default font used for most things.
    * Unfortunately, it doesn't contain the symbols mentioned above, so the
      SL Viewer will resort to the fallback fonts...
  * FontSansSerifFallback MSGOTHIC.TTC;gulim.ttc;simhei.ttf;ArialUni.ttf
    * These are the fonts used if a character can't be found in the FontSansSerif font.

In all likelyhood, you are missing one or more of these fonts, or have old
versions of these fonts.  There are four possible ways to fix this problem.

* Method #1, Install the "East Asian Language Pack"

   * This contains a few of the fonts above.
   * Instructions can be found here:
     http://www.astahost.com/info.php/adding-east-asian-fonts-system_t8934.html
   * Restart your SL Viewer.

* Method #2, Install "Microsoft Office 2002" or later
   
   * It contains ArialUni.ttf.  Instructions can be found here:
     http://support.microsoft.com/kb/287247
   * Restart your SL Viewer.

* Method #3, Install some other font and add it to the fallback list

   * While it isn't the prettiest, the GNU unifont.ttf seems to work.
   * Go to http://www.lgm.cl/trabajos/unifont/index.en.html
   * Get the unifont.zip, unpack it, and copy the unifont.ttf to
     C:\windows\fonts
   * Add ";unifont.ttf" to the end of FontSansSerifFallback.
   * Restart your SL Viewer.

   * Instead of unifont, you may want to try "dejavu sans", which is a bit
     prettier, available at:
     http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Download

* Method #4, Install some other font and change the default font

   * On Mac and Linux, the FontSansSerifFallback gets regenerated at client
     startup, so changes there don't stick.
   * Also, it seems not all fonts in the fallback list are used, which makes
     it pretty useless.
   * As in #3 above, grab the unifont.ttf file (or some other file) and install it
   * Change the "FontSansSerif" to be the full path to the unifont.ttf
   * Restart your SL Viewer.

Problems with Browser Fonts
---------------------------

Like the viewer, some web browsers may have problems with the characters used
for symbols in the http://opengate.ma8p.com/list.cgi .  Solutions for this
will vary by browser and are out of scope for this document, but in general:

 * Make sure you're using the latest version of your browser
 * Check your browser's fonts for support of these characters
