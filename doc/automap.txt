The automap object
------------------

Touch the Stargate and select the "Automap".  The Stargate will vend you
an automap object.  If you wear the automap object, the map will appear
automatically when you collide with (walk through) the event horizon.
This saves you a click, and makes the action a bit more realistic.
You still need to click the "teleport" button on the map.

Several people have asked why the automap is necessary, and why we
can't just have "walk-through" teleports.  This is an SL limitation.
See http://jira.secondlife.com/browse/SVC-212 for a full history on this
subject.  Many people have pointed out that the Quantum Gate stargates
have walk through teleport.  Strictly speaking, this is not true.
To activate a quantum portal stargate, you need to touch the Stargate.
The touch handler delays until a collision is detected by a second script.
Only the person who originally touched the Stargate gets the "walk
through teleport".  Others in the area must still touch the event horizon.
This solution is clunky, and causes new users quite a bit of confusion.
Rather than implement a broken and confusing solution like this, the
Open Stargate Network encourages you to use the automap
object, and vote for SVC-212.

#@tpto support#; Some viewers (Phoenix, Restrained Life, Cool, and possibly others)
have a feature which DOES allow forced teleports.  The
automap object will detect this feature and use it if it is available.

Note some viewers may require special steps to enable RLV.  See

#Push feature#; Inspired by scenes in the show where characters appear to
be "pushed" out of the wormhole on arrival, one resident suggested we add
this feature.  This feature is OFF by default.  To enable it, detach your
automap, right click it in your inventory, select "properties" and add
"{push}" to the description.  Now wear it again.  Push enabled automaps
will give you a gentle push out the wormhole when you arrive, if you
arrive close to the Stargate and if the land you arrive on allows it.

#Radio feature#; The automap object also acts as a radio.
The default radio channel is 7, and can be changed via the {radio:}
setting in the automap object description.  If you speak on the radio
channel (i.e. type */7 hello* in the chat bar), all others with automap
objects set to the same channel will hear you.  This will even work
through open wormholes.
