Stargate Themes
---------------

The two classic models (oneprim and eleven) support a number of
themes (texture sets, sounds, and associated objects) that allow you to
change the look of the Stargate.  Other models may also honor
some theme settings.  To change the theme, touch your stargate, select
"ADMIN", "THEME" from the menu, and select the theme you want.

When changing themes, it may take up to two minutes for the chevrons
to change on the oneprim model.

Themes are contained in notecards inside the Open Stargate named
"@theme:whatever".

When you select a theme, the textures/sounds/etc referenced by the theme
notecard are used to change the appearance of your Stargate.  If subsequent
software updates change the contents of the notecard, your Stargate will
change appearance to match the new updates.

Changes to existing stock notecards will be lost during an update.  To make
changes that persist through updates, make a copy of the notecard with a
different name.

theme format
............

A theme notecard consists of a list of setting value pairs, one per line.

Since reading notecards is relatively slow, and the settings are
generally self explanatory, there is no provision for comments in the
theme notecards.

The following settings are recognized by the theme reader.  Settings in
the theme notecard may appear in any order.  Unrecognized settings
are ignored.
