Stargate Placement
------------------

It's always annoying to walk through a Stargate and come out somewhere random,
far away from any visible Stargate.  Sort of breaks the mood, you know?

Please, as a courtesy to other Stargate travelers, do not place your Stargates
on land with restricted access ("about land" / "access" should not have
any check boxes selected), or with a teleport routing away from the Stargate
("about land" / "options" / "teleport routing" should say "anywhere").
Alternately, you can set "teleport routing" to "landing point", and
place the Stargate at the landing point.  If you wish to have a seperate
landing point from the Stargate, you might consider splitting off the 4x4
m^2 section containing the Stargate ("edit terrain", "subdivide").

Also, if placing your Stargate in a private region, make sure region
permissions are set to allow people to teleport to the region.
