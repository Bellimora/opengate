Quick Setup Guide
-----------------

This section is meant to give a brief overview of what to do to set up
your Open Stargate.  It is intended for first time owners who have never
set one up before.  The nitty gritty details are found elsewhere in this
document.  This section is meant as an overview only.

* (Optional) Rez the "Steps and Gate Area" or "Destiny gate stand" first.
  These are optional scenery items you might want if you can spare the
  prims.
* (Required) Rez the "opengate:" of your choice.  If you're using the steps
  or stand you'll want to position this over them so it sinks in a bit and
  you'll be able to walk through the OpenGate.
* (Optional) Rez any other items ("dhd", "addressdisplay", "statusdisplay"
  These are optional scenery items you might want if you can spare the
  prims. (see below)
* (Required) Wear the "updater".  This will start loading scripts and
  objects into your OpenGate.
* (Optional) Drop a texture into your OpenGate.  This texture will appear as a
  60x45 graphic next to your gate in the gate list at
  http://opengate.ma8p.com/list.cgi

The distribution box comes with other goodies you may want to use.  Here's
what they are and how they work.

* "addressdisplay"
  This displays the symbols for your OpenGate's address.
* "statusdisplay"
  This high tech device shows the current status of your OpenGate.  Clicking
  on it also brings up a menu of addresses.  You can change what's in the menu
  by modifying the notecard inside.
* "dhd"
  This is a dialing device.  Click the button in the middle to dial a random
  gate.  Or click on symbols, followed by the center button, to dial an
  address.
