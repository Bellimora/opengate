Where to get an Open Stargate
-----------------------------

Any Open Stargate can vend you the release package.  Touch the Stargate, and

to get the release package.

Caveat Emptor
.............

The Open Stargate Network is a free open source project.  The code
is freely available under the terms of the GPL, and the objects are
distributed with full permissions.  These sorts of items are commonly
called "freebies" in Second Life.  There are unscrupulous people who
will take advantage of freebies by repackaging them and selling them to
unsuspecting people.

If you purchased your copy from someone and are upset about it, we
strongly encourage you to leave feedback on the item in whatever forum
you found it to let others know how much you enjoy it and how they can
get their own for free.  The Open Stargate Network can not and will not
"refund" your money, as we do not receive any of the proceeds of these
unscrupulous sales.

If you purchased the item in the SL marketplace, please also "flag
this item" and select "spam or disallowed listing practices", "inflated
listing price".
